## Conferences/Volunteering

### Avengercon V - "Rapid Application Development for Emergency Response Scenarios" - December 2020

Rapid application development tools, sometimes referred to as "low code" or "no-code" in common buzzword, provide a clear boost when you need to quickly adapt to a changing situation on the ground during an emergency response situation. Higher headquarters information gathering requirements change, reporting formats proliferate, and oftentimes the Tactical Operations Center is left massaging data from emails, texts, and attached spreadsheets into the format of the day.

In this talk, I will provide an introduction to some tools which I've found useful on the marketplace that you can use to help consolidate and assist in "battle tracking", including the development of one unit's information management workflow from email thread to spreadsheet to single, unified Common Operating Picture, available securely to provide visibility to all echelons of the battalion.

As a Florida National Guardsman, I have responded to 5 hurricanes with the state and I will show you some tricks for helping evolve your data management quickly.

### Great American Teach In - Speaker - [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fh9LzLK---iwmaeZr9i871KvtWVT8OvvJCZ8jYFndRU/edit?usp=sharing)

The Great American Teach-In is an annual event coordinated by the Polk County Public Schools’ Department of Public Relations and Strategic Partnerships to celebrate American Education Week.

During this event, members of the community are invited to speak to students about their careers, travel and hobbies, and how their early educational experiences relate to their current lives.

Students enjoy the opportunity to hear real stories from real community members. Each year Teach-In volunteers inspire students to stay focused and keep looking ahead to the future. In previous years, volunteers have come in costume, shown students their work-related equipment, performed songs, dances and plays, offered potentially life-saving information, showed off their pets, discussed career options, shared precious souvenirs, talked about other parts of the world, cooked delicious meals, stepped down from the pedestal of celebrity to meet students at their level, or simply read a story.

The Teach-In introduces students to career options they might never have considered, hobbies they might never have discovered, and activities they might never have experienced.

#### July 2016 - "Moving Fast Without Breaking Things in .NET"

### [Code Lakeland](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Lakeland) - Speaker
